[General Info] 
This was a pretty cool assignment to try and figure out! We were tasked with creating a quiz using javascript and making it fit into our html document upon user entering the webpage. 

[Assignment Details] When the user arrives at your page they should receive a prompt alert letting them know that a quiz is about start. Within this same pop up are the rules for the quiz stating that there is a time limit as well and for every question that is wrong then there will be an additional timer decrease. 

[How To Setup] 
The files within this document are going to be updated on a regular basis! However....there are some things to be aware of.

-The css style sheet is located in the same folder under style.css. Still adding the style to this one as there was a bit of difficulty adding the questions to the actual document itself.

-As stated before, this is a work in progress! Notes on things that have not been worked out yet are marked in green notation (or possibly another color depending on what you prefer).

5.The javascript file is save in the assets folder for future reference. Same goes for the css file.

[Look-Out!] As stated before the page is still a work in progress! The page is nice and basic with a little bit of CSS to give the page a little bit of order. There are a lot of things that have been commented out as I did not want to lose my train of thought while trying different things to get the code to work with the password generator button. The popups work just fine however. There were a few times where I would try to work on the button and the popups would disappear; resulting in a lot of things being commented out so that way I would not lose any of the thoughts in progress but still have the ability to keep the page up and functioning somewhat. Still working on getting the questions and answers from the array and implementing them into the DOM. Will return to this early in the AM to see if there is something that can be done to resolve the issue.
